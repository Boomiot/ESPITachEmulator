#iTach Emulator for the ESP8266

This library partially implements Global Cache's irsend protocol on the ESP8266 platform, allowing infrared send/receive actions to be efficiently executed across a TCP/IP connection. The complete protocol is documented in the following PDF: https://www.globalcache.com/files/docs/API-iTach.pdf

Global Cache has an impressive line of products which are well worth their costs, and purchasing their product from one of their distributors.
